- Hi, I’m Leo Hsu. A student studies in National Taiwan University, majoring in Forestry and Environmental Resources Conservation.
  
- Due to the passion of programming, I took some required courses in NTU CSIE & NTU EE.
  
- For example, Data Structure and Algorithm(B+), Algorithm Desingn and Analysis(A-), Operating System(A+), Computer Networks(A+), Computer Vision(A+), Discrete Math, Computer Architecture, etc.
  
- Currently, I’m interested in computer vision and deep learning, and have done an AOI projec of PCR testing machine in OME Techonology.
